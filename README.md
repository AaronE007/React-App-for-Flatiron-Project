# SeaFood Extravaganza!

## Description 
This project is a collection of seafood-specific recipes for seafood lovers and pescatarians alike. When looking for new takes on seafood recipes, the user can use a search for them with keywords in the search bar. Users can also simply scroll through the list to browse through a simple collection of recipes. Recipes appear on the "Recipes" page as a card with a title and image.

Once a user has found a recipe that looks appetizing, they simply have to click on the "Click to See Recipe button." After this button is pressed, the card will flip, and an ingredients list accompanied by the directions to make the recipe will appear. The user can then either leave the card open to compare it to another recipe or they can click the "see the recipe completed button" to revert the card to an image of the completed product.

If the user has a recipe that they would love to contribute to the product, they can add it by navigating to the "Add Recipes From" at the top of the page with the nav bar. They then have four text boxes to complete and when they enter their recipe they will be directed back to the list of recipes. They then can find their recipe by scrolling to the bottom of the page.

I made this project because I love the culinary arts and love fresh food from the sea. My favorite aspect of my application is that you can become part of a cooking community by adding recipes to the server. Cooking should always be communal. More information about the website can be found on the "About" page and a link to my GitHub can be found in the footer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
